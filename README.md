## Mythic Framework

# ðŸš§DISCLAIMERðŸš§
We do not own this framework, and we am simply trying to give it the support it deserves. The framework was originally built by Alzar & Dr Nick. Alzar has taken the liberty of releasing the framework, which you can find by following the [original repository](https://github.com/Alzar/mythic-framework)
